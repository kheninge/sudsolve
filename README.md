# sudsolve
A suduko solving assistant

Take a shot at defining my own suduko solver as a way to hone my python skills and to implement a Qt gui. The approach here is not to create a solver that will brute force any puzzle, but rather to create rules for logical inference and then allow the user to run those rules in whatever order they choose. When there are no more solutions that can be found through the logical rules the user can choose a solution and see it through to see if it leads to an error or a solution.

A windows binary is available under releases.
